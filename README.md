# mvskoke-web-app
Web app to host vocab, phrases, and recordings for the Mvskoke language.

## Purpose
The goal is to have a way for tribal members to easily add phrases and recordings of fluent speakers.  Currently there exists a dictionary for the language, but for the purposes of language preservation and revitalization, hearing the language spoken is crucial.  A tool like this could supplement language learning by providing a searchable database of phrases, so that learners can see and hear how words are used in sentences.  

The intent is not so much to be a teaching tool, as there are already many great flashcard and quiz apps.  Rather this would be a reference to aid in the creation of such quizes and self-study.

A significant aspect to consider is the vetting of recording submissions.  The hope is that the tribal community would have ownership over the database, and that includes monitoring the quality and accuracy of submissions.

## Tech Stack
